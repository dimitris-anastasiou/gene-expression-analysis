# Gene Expression Analysis using R

## Objective
This project involves analyzing gene expression data to understand the effects of a BET inhibitor treatment on a pancreatic cell line. The analysis includes data preprocessing, quality control, differential expression analysis, and functional enrichment analysis using R and Bioconductor packages. The goal is to identify significantly overexpressed and underexpressed genes and understand the biological processes affected by the treatment.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Directory containing CEL files for each sample.
- `GeneExpressionAnalysis.Rmd`: Main script for the gene expression analysis.
